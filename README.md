Welcome to the help file of encryptor AES 192
--------------------------------------------------
	In this software we were asked to implement AES 192 encryption, in the implementation
we have used php APIs which helped us through the process. Due to time constrain we had to implement the
software in php in-build functions. Nevertheless we wrote the actual implementation of the code but
unfortunately we couldn't finish on time (Why we used APIs).

-----------
Front-end!
-----------
	The front-end of encryptor was written from scratch, all the CSS was written from scratch. 
Actually we did that with our own framework called "Sfast" an open source framework for styling
HTML content that we came up with a few days before the projects were given...
The design might not be perfect because Sfast doesn't have all styling implementation yet.

-----------
Back-end!
-----------
	The back-end was written in php with no database connection. We used php APIs to implement the actual back-end of this software.
